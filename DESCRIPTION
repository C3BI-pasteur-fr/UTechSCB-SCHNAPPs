Description: Single Cell sHiny APPlication (SCHNAPPs) is a R/Shiny based application to interact, manipulate, explore, and analyze single cell RNA-seq experiments, including MARS-seq and others.
    The application is open and extendable. The main idea is to be able to run basic visualization and analyses, including normalization, clustering,...
    on a defined subset of cells/genes. Key is, that all computations are based only on the cells that have been selected. Input can be a 
    SingleCellExperiment object or CSV/TSV files of the count matrix.
